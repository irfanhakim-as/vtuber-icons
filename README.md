## Contributing

- If you have a logo you'd like to add to this repository, please create a pull request or an issue with the following information:

  1. The logo's subject (i.e. Brand name, Programming language name, etc.)
  2. The logo's original source link (i.e. Twitter post, GitHub repository, etc.)
  3. The logo's creator/owner (i.e. Twitter profile, GitHub profile, etc.)

- If it is a PR that you're making, please ensure that the logo you're adding is original and not modified in any way. Name the file with the following convention:

    - If the subject name is one word (i.e. `Plex`), use the subject name, in lowercase, as the file name (i.e. `plex.png`).
    - If the subject name is more than one word (i.e. `OBS Studio`), use the subject name, in lowercase, with hyphens as the separator (i.e. `obs-studio.jpg`).
    - If an existing (different) logo is already in the list, add an underscore and a number at the end of the file name starting from the number `1` (i.e. `steam-link_1.svg`).

- Please ensure that the logo you're adding is not already in the list **UNLESS** the logo you're adding is a higher quality (but still original, not modified) version of the existing logo.

- Do note however that a single _Subject_ can have more than one logo in the list, just not duplicates of the same logo.

- **ONLY** publicly available logos are allowed in this repository. Do **NOT** add any logos that are not publicly available or are behind a paywall **UNLESS** you are the original creator or have the creator's permission to do so.
